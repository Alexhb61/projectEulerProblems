# ProjectEulerProblems
6 languages
I am going to cycle through the problems and languages.
If the problem number mod 6 is:
#0, I will code it in C++ via Rstudio or Eclipse, Probably Eclipse
#1, I will code it in R via Rstudio
#2, I will code it in Java via BlueJ
#3, I will code it in Python via a yet to be determined IDE
#4, I will maybe write Javascript Code??? How??? possibly in the unity engine?
#5, I will write the code in C# in a unity program?

After doing a ton of the coding bat problems, I need a new fun past-time, and I would like to keep it organized
